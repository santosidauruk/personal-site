Hi, I'm Santo. A software engineer and freelance developer from Medan, Indonesia. Thanks for stopping by. It's good to have you here.

Currently, I'm working in  LinkAja, one of the fintech companies in Indonesia. Some project that we currently working on is the design system and CMS template that will be used in various teams.

The tech stack that I use usually are [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and occasionally [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

Software engineering is fun for me, although sometimes it feels exhausting. But it offers endless learning and  sometimes it's surprising to see that so many problems can be solved through technology. If you feel the same or just want to connect, you can reach me via email hello@santosidauruk.com or [twitter](https://twitter.com/santosidauruk) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_vincensiuss/).

Thanks and have a good day!
